Hi Gill,

I wanted to share some thoughts on how you've been smashing your H1 goals.

Your efforts to make our team feel included and heard have been brilliant. You live by our team's values, showing respect and empathy, which really sets the tone for all of us. I love how you always make sure everyone gets a chance to have their say in meetings and don't let any one person hog the spotlight.

Your own drive to learn and grow is infectious. You're always open to new ideas and pushing us to think about different ways to get things done. It's super helpful and inspires us all to better ourselves.

I appreciate how you make us look at our performance, both as individuals and as a team. You often kickstart discussions or tasks, which helps break the ice and encourages the rest of us to jump in.

In short, you're doing a great job encouraging an open, inclusive team culture, and promoting personal and team growth. Keep it up!
