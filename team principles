## Team Communication Principles

1. **Promote Healthy Dialogue:** 

    - Encourage open conversation; disagreement should be framed constructively.
    - Donâ€™t create discomfort by flatly opposing ideas; instead, express your doubts or concerns in a supportive manner.
    - Explore alternate perspectives with an open mind.

2. **Foster Understanding and Active Listening:** 

    - Demonstrate understanding by summarizing others' points before raising counterpoints.
    - Listen attentively, focusing on the speaker's point rather than formulating a response.
    - Avoid interrupting with counter-arguments. 

3. **Inquiry over Confrontation:** 

    - If you have concerns about a suggestion, ask questions or raise points for consideration rather than flatly disagreeing.
    - Encourage discussion on all potential aspects, even on matters of compliance.

4. **Maintain an Open and Adaptive Mindset:** 

    - Allow yourself and others to change their mind without becoming defensive.
    - Recognize that there can be multiple solutions to a problem.
    - Use disagreements as a starting point for collaborative problem-solving.

5. **Practice Considerate Communication:** 

    - Use language that fosters conversation and allows for differing opinions without causing defensiveness.
    - Frame your confidence in a way that still leaves room for discussion (e.g., "Unless I'm missing something...").

6. **Encourage Team Involvement and Recognition:** 

    - Allow room for others to lead and shine; offer frequent recognition and credit.
    - Encourage a culture where even those who make mistakes feel confident contributing in the future.
