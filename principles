foster conversations. If you disagree  with something or don’t think it’s a good idea, it only causes frustration when you flat out disagree we don’t want others to feel uncomfortable.
demonstrate understanding of their viewpoint e.g by summarising their suggestion before making any counterpoints. Its frustrating when someone doesn’t think you are listening . or fully get their point.
if you have concerns about a suggestion, instead of flatly disagreeing, ask questions or raise points they may not have considerer. e.g I see what you are thinking, we would need to think about how we do this is a compliant way
Allow yourself and the other person to change their mind without feeling defensive.
Even if someone makes a bad suggestion we don’t want them to feel unconfident in the future.
Try to actively listen , focus on understanding the point they are making rather than just thinking it’s a bad idea and trying to formulate a response.
Demonstrate consideration of other viewpoints. Always knowledge other viewpoints in a positive manner , never interrupt with counter arguments.
have an open mind, accept there are different solutions to problems and different opinions. Look for similarities as a starting point in the discussion.
be careful with words, put things in a way that allow conversation or difference of option without making yourself or others feel defensive.  Say things in a way that allow yourself to change your mind or foster a conversation.
Even if 99% confident still allow room for healthy debate .
E.g “unless im missing something “ xxxxx 
allow others to shine ,give frequent credit, step back and allow others to lead
